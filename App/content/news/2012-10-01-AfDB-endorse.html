The African Development Bank (AfDB) was one of the first development institutions to pinpoint the locations of all of its projects approved from 2009-2010 as part of its 2011 Annual Review. The AfDB is now scaling up this initiative to include all active projects. In joining the Open Aid Partnership , the AfDB will contribute actively in increasing the transparency of development aid with the other partners.
