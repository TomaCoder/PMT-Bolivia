During the Visegrad 4 (V4; Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland) Conference 'Enhancing Partnership between V4 Countries and the World Bank Group' in Prague on 21 March, the World Bank Institute presented a map of the aidflows of these four countries to Moldova. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs had provided the data of their bilateral development cooperation programs in Moldova in the period 2009-2011. In addition, all World Bank projects in Moldova were mapped.

<p>During the Visegrad 4 (V4; Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland) Conference 'Enhancing Partnership between V4 Countries and the World Bank Group' in Prague on 21 March, the World Bank Institute presented a map of the aid flows of these four countries to Moldova. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs had provided the data of their bilateral development cooperation programs in Moldova in the period 2009-2011. In addition, all World Bank projects in Moldova were mapped. Even without having mapped all donors active in Moldova, the map below already shows quite a complex donor-landscape.</p>

<p>All V4 countries are emerging donors. With relatively small Aid budgets, discussions about harmonization, effectiveness and visibility are very relevant, especially since their priority countries such as Ukraine, Serbia, Moldova etc. overlap. Since the base map can be changed to reflect different MDGs, it can be useful as a planning tool. During the V4-meeting, the map was presented and sparked the discussions about enhanced cooperation between the four countries.</p>

<p>The Czech Republic also used the meeting to announce their endorsement of the Open Aid Partnership and will partner with the World Bank Institute in exploring ways to partner in geo-coding all their new and existing development cooperation projects.</p>
