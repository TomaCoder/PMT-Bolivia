Publish What You Fund (PWYF) campaigns for aid transparency - more and better information about aid. They insist that transparency is essential if aid is truly to deliver on its
promise. Knowing what is being spent where, by whom, and with what results is the basic foundation for reducing poverty and empowering citizens. We are happy to receive an
endorsement of the Open Aid Partnership by PWYF and look forward to collaborating with them on this common goal.
