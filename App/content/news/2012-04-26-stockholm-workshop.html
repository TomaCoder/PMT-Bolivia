<p>Sweden's Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the World Bank Institute (WBI) co-organized a technical workshop in Stockholm, Sweden on April 26, 2012 to bring together the Open Aid Partners and better understand the power of sub-national mapping of development projects. Participants learnt about the key concepts of sub-national data collection and geo-coding and exchanged ideas about how to implement them. </p>

<p>14 donors and development organizations participated in the workshop, including: Africa Development Bank, Akvo/Openaid.nl, Canada, Czech Republic, Development Gateway, Finland, Foundation Center, IATI Secretariat, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, United States, UNOPS, and UN Habitat. </p>

<p>During the workshop, participants used the geo-coding toolkit developed by WBI and Development Gateway and mapped their projects in 3 countries: Moldova, Nepal and Tanzania. Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK presented their mapping pilots and experiences thus far.</p>
