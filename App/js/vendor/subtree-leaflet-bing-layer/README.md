leaflet-bing-layer
==================

Extend leaflet code so Bing basemaps can be used.  Code originally pulled from https://github.com/shramov/leaflet-plugins.  No fork created because 1) we only need Bing layer, and 2) repo does not appear to be actively maintained.

Usage:

var myBingBasemap = new L.BingLayer('my bing api key here');
