On October 25th, the Open Aid Partnership together with Publish What You Fund were organizing an event as a part of the Global Transparency Week. Speakers around the globe gave a series of short presentations demonstrating the power of using open development data to inform decisions and improve results. Successful examples of aid transparency were showcased, with a focus on the geography of aid as well as country-owned data reported by partner governments. The speakers in La Paz, Lilongwe, Nairobi, Kathmandu, Washington DC, and other locations were connected through Hangout On Air and their lightning talks (short, 5-minute presentations) could be followed online by anyone.
