<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland hosted the 2nd Open Aid Partners Meeting during the Open Knowledge Festival in Helsinki on September 18, 2012.</p>

<h4>Agenda</h4>

</p>

<h4>Discussion of the 4 pilot countries</h4>

<p>Partners nominated Bolivia, Kenya, Nepal, and Tanzania for piloting first phase OAP activities. The partnership will support selected countries to better manage aid flows by developing country-owned open aid mapping platforms and strategic partnerships with civil society organizations to act as &quot;information intermediaries&quot; at the local level. Countries have been selected based on their engagement in ongoing open government and open aid initiatives; country demand; aid fragmentation; and based on a partner survey. The OAP Team has begun to engage these four countries to begin the pilot activities.</p>

<h4>Discussion of the Common Mapping Platform</h4>

<p>Partners discussed functionality, scope, and technology for an Open Aid Map. Partners agreed that the Open Aid Map should aggregate and visualize location data from various sources including donors and pilot countries. Also the Open aid Map should integrate selected IATI datasets. The Open Aid Map should allow for creating instances for country applications. Partners strongly supported building the Open Aid Map based on an open source solution and requested that all data would be open to use and shared freely. (See the <a href="content/news/docs/OAP-Concept_and_Guidance_Note_for_Creating_an_Open_Aid_Map.pdf">Discussion document</a>, PDF.)</p>

<h4>Discussion of the Geo-coding methodology and linkages with other donor reporting mechanisms, including an update from meetings between Canadian CIDA, WBI and others.</h4>

<p>CIDA and the World Bank reported on a meeting in Ottawa in August. The meeting aimed at aligning different geo-coding methods. In particular, some limitations of the current IATI and World Bank-AidData standard for capturing bilateral data were adressed. Participants agreed on additions to this standard that to better accommodate bilateral donors' needs including capturing the location of beneficiaries in addition to investments as well as funding to supranational organizations. It was proposed that Partners would test these additions with the goal to propose a final set of changes to IATI. Proposed additions are changes are documented in the attached Outcome Document of the Ottawa Meeting.

<h4>Initial discussion of designing/implementing evaluations for open aid initiatives, including the approach developed for OAP</h4>

<p>During a brainstorming session participants explored opportunities for evaluating the activities the Open Aid Partnership. The challenge of evaluating the impact of the availability of open data and particularly open aid data was greatly acknowledged. Partners agreed to develop a more elaborate results framework and explore a wider range of evaluation methods including participatory monitoring, perception-based surveys, and focus groups. A draft document for discussion will be circulated within the next 2-3 weeks.<br>
